List Course: the goal of this course is to understand how lists are constructed via recursive consing and deconstructed via pattern matching as well to work with some basic list functions (especially maps and filters)

List Datatype
- goal: understand the datatype, how lists are constructed, and how to deconstruct with pattern matching

Basic list functions
- goal: get comfortable with some basic list functions

List comprehensions
- goal: familarity with list comprehension syntax

Map
- goal: understand how map's recursion works and how to use it on lists

Filter
- goal: understand how to interpret the type of `filter` and use with lists

Zipping lists
- goal: understand how zip and zipWith work

String manipulation
- goal: use maps and filters to do some String manipulations

Data.List
- goal: explore some of the functions that live in this module
